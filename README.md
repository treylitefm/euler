# Welcome!

Hey there, and welcome to my Project Euler Sandbox. Recently, I've decided to dedicate my free time to trying to solve 100+ of the 500 problems on <a href="http://projecteuler.net/problems">project euler</a>. If you've never seen it, then feel free to take a look and join me on my quest. The coding problems are mathematical in nature, but all leverage the power of computing to arrive at an answer. Note: when scripting an algorithm, try to keep the run time **under 60 seconds** or else your solution doesn't count. Lastly, some problems don't actually require you to write a single line of code (cmd+f, then manually searching for solution, or *cough* **google** *cough*). However, what fun is there in not writing code :)

Gentle(wo)men, let the journey begin. Best of luck!

**On the horizon:**

- Web UI for convenient interaction with some of the algorithms
